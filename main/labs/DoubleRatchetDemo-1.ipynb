    "## Lab Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab gives you an opportunity to look at the internals the SIGNAL protocol and its use of X3DH and\n",
    "the double-ratchet mechanism.   The code is a simplified Python duplication of the relevant SIGNAL components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of this lab requires you to simply examine and execute the python cells to see what kind of output is produced. Feel free to change crypto keys variables to see what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The very last exercise will require you to write a tiny amount of original code in order to encrypt a new message and verify that the ratchet values did indeed \"click\" to a new state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook can be run on your own laptop or on a CS lab machine or by means of SSH tunnel to a CS lab machine to view the notebook on your local laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the python libraries and command dependencies to successfully run this lab should already be installed and available on the CS lab machines. If a library will not import, you should use the --user option in pip to install the library to your own userid. Example:\n",

    "    https://sna.cs.colostate.edu/software/jupyter/\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running on your own laptop, you should install the necessary libraries yourself using the pip3 command as described later in this lab. I recomnad to setup Anconda to your machine,for example use the link below to install it on mac:\n",

    "\n",
    "We will now create a new class that defines the Message Ratchet.  We will also rebuild the Bob and Alice classes to add a function that initializes their send and receive ratchets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The symmetric ratchet is implemented with a KDF chain using the HKDF algorithm, which ensures that the output will be cryptographically secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the initial step, the KDF function is supplied with a secret key and some input data, which can be a constant. The output of the KDF is another secret key. This new key is split into two parts: The next KDF key and the message key. This is a turn of the “ratchet”: The internal state of the ratchet (the KDF key) is changed and a new message key is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs456/images/symmRatchet.png\" width=\"350px\" alt=\"ratchet\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the output of the KDF algorithm is cryptographically secure, it’s hard to reconstruct the input key of the KDF given the output key. This means that an attacker can’t reconstruct older keys even if the current state and message key is leaked. They can however decrypt a single message by using the message key. In addition, by changing the input parameter on each step, we are also guaranteed break-in recovery: An attacker can’t deduce the next state of the ratchet by only knowing the current state if they don’t know what the input is. If the input is constant however an attacker can sync with the ratchet and decrypt all future messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having performed the X3DH algorithm, both Alice and Bob have now arrived at a common shared secret key. That is now used to establish their session keys by using the Double Ratchet algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of them maintains three symmetric ratchets in order to be able to communicate. The first one is the root ratchet. This ratchet is initialized with the shared key of Alice and Bob. The input of this ratchet can be assumed to be constant for now, which however does not provide break-in recovery. This will change in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two ratchets are the sending and receiving ratchets. Alice’s sending ratchet’s state must always match Bob’s receiving ratchet state, and vice-versa. These two ratchets are both initialized from the first two keys provided by the root chain. When Alice wants to send a message to Bob, she turns her sending ratchet once, obtaining a new message key. She then encrypts her message using that message key.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs456/images/ratchetPairs.png\" width=\"350px\" alt=\"message ratchets\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, Bob initializes his sending and receiving ratchets by turning his root ratchet twice. When he receives a message from Alice he turns his receiving ratchet once, matching the state of Alice’s sending ratchet. This provides him with the key to decrypt the message. He can send messages to Alice in a similar fashion, using his sending ratchet and Alice’s receiving ratchet.\n",
    "\n",
    "By having two separate ratchets for sending and receiving, we make sure that Bob and Alice won’t have an issue of both claiming the same key from their ratchets and sending each other a message at the same time. Each message is also accompanied by the order that it was sent. This way, if Bob receives a message out of order, he can turn his receiving ratchet more than once to get the appropriate message key to decrypt it. He also stores the message keys that he skipped in case these messages arrive, so that he can then decrypt them.\n",

    "Let’s add a simple ratchet implementation to our code, and the initialization methods to Bob and Alice.\n"

    "The second ratchet type is the Diffie-Hellman ratchet which is used to reset the keys used for the sending and receiving ratchets of both parties to new values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before receiving a message from Alice, Bob must initialize a new ratchet key pair RK_b and advertise the public key to Alice. Upon learning Bob’s public key, Alice will then generate her own key pair RK_a and calculate DH(RK_a, RK_b). This value will be used as the input to turn Alice’s root symmetric ratchet once, yielding a new key. This key will then be used to initialize Alice’s sending symmetric ratchet.\n",

    "<img src=\"http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs456/images/dhRatchet.png\" width=\"350px\" alt=\"DH ratchet\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Bob can introduce a new key pair RK_b'. Using Alice’s previous public key he calculates DH(RK_b', RK_a) and uses that as input to his root chain to get a new key for initializing his sending ratchet. He can now discard his old key pair. When he sends his new message, encrypted with the sending ratchet, he advertises his new public key. Alice can then once again calculate DH(RK_a, RK_b') to update her receiving ratchet and decrypt Bob’s message, and can proceed with introducing her own new key pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the input values for the sending and receiving ratchets are still constant. The input value for the root symmetric ratchet is, however, the output value of the DH ratchet. This way we now also ensure eventual break-in recovery: Even if the state of a ratchet is leaked to an attacker, we will soon afterwards perform a turn of the DH ratchet and the symmetric ratchets will be reset to new, unknown to the attacker values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process signifies a single turn of the DH ratchet, as in each step one party’s key is renewed and the old one is forgotten. It can be performed as often as the two parties like in order to provide break-in recovery. In practice it’s done with every single message.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, we can add the code for maintaining the DH ratchet by both Bob and Alice. We don’t need a new construct for the DH ratchet, as it’s sufficient to keep an X25519 key pair for each user."
